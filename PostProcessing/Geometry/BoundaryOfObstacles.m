% Function that check whether a point is or not in a scatterer.
% This function return a matrix "res" of the same size of X or Y, obtained
% by "meshgrid".
% Coefficient res(i,j) is equal to:
%  p if the point (X(i,j), Y(i,j)) belongs to the boundary of Omega_p
%  0 otherwise (outside every obstacles)
% The obstacles are supposed to be circular.
% ----------------------------------------------------------
% res = BoundaryOfObstacles(X, Y, O, a)
% 
% Input (N_scat = number of obstacle = length(a))
% -----
%   X [Nx x Ny]     : Meshgrid in X
%   Y [Nx x Ny]     : Meshgrid in Y
%   O [2 x N_scat]  : Matrix of the coordinates of the center of the
%                     scatterers
%   a [1 x N_scat]  : Vector of the radii of the scatterers
%
% Output
% ------
%   res [Nx x Ny]   : Matrix where the coefficient (i,j) is equal to:
%                     0 if the point X(i,j), Y(i,j) is outside the scatterers
%                     0 if the point X(i,j), Y(i,j) is inside the p^th scatterer
%                     p if the point X(i,j), Y(i,j) is on the boundary 
%                     of the p^h scatterers
